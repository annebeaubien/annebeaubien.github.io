Can you guess the secret ingredient in this pie? It was commonly added to desserts in the 18th centure but has since fallen out of fashion because it's very easy to use too much. I use just a half teaspoon across two entire pies and it's just enough. Any more than that is too much and will over power all of the other flavors.  

You can peel the apples but it's not necessary.

I usually use Pink Lady apples and will sometimes add in a Granny Smith.

**Equipment:** 2 pie plates, baking sheet

---

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat oven to 375ºF. Place two pie plates on baking paper lined baking sheets. This helps in case the pie boils over (which has not yet happened for me but you might use juicier apples than I do so it could happen for you).
1. Core the apples, then slice into 1/4-1/2 inch thick wedges. 
1. In a separate bowl combine the sugar, starch, applesauce, lime juice, cardamom and rose water.
1. Pour the sugar mixture on top of the apples and combine with a spatula or wooden spoon.
1. Divide the apple mixture between the pie plates.
1. In a clean bowl, sift together the flour, sugar and salt. Then add the softened butter and combine by squeezing it through your hands until it is homogenous. It will still be crumbly. 
1. Crumble the mixture on top of the pie filling. 
1. Bake for 40-50 min at 375ºF until the top of the crust is starting to brown.
