These bars are easy to make, and dissapear quickly in my house. I like to make multiple batches at once and freeze they. They're great frozen and right from the fridge. The will soften up if left out and don't hold up as well in warm weather. 

If you're making this gluten-free make sure to get gluten-free oats. 

Tip: if your honey is very solid and not pourable then put the jar into a bowl of hot water for 10 minutes. Make sure no water gets into the jar. This will soften it making it easier to mix into the batter.
