When I first made this recipe I was sure I was going to have to replace the cheese with some other ingredient like nutritional yeast. However, I tried it and realized that by taking out the cheese you really taste the fresh basil! I found that I didn’t miss the cheese at all. This sauce is great over your favorite pasta, gnocchi or steamed vegetables.
