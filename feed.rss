Literally “rice grain porridge” this creamy, cinnamon sugar porridge is enjoyed mostly as lunch on Christmas Eve but also sometimes throughout the month at gatherings. To play the Christmas Eve porridge game you put a peeled almond into the serving pot. Then everyone takes a scoop and whoever gets the almond wins a marzipan pig! Make sure to make enough extra so that you can leave a bowl of porridge out for the nisse on the night of the 24th of December. Nisse are naughty elves that live in the woods and they cause mischief in your house if you don’t bribe them with a bowl of porridge. The nisse are also the ones in charge of washing and caring for the Christmas pig…pork belly is the main dish for many Norwegian Christmas dinners…which is probably why the marzipan is shaped like a pig.</p><p>The way you eat this is just as important as the way you make it! Once you have your bowl of porridge in front of you, make a well in the center and put in a dollop of butter. Then cover the whole bowl with cinnamon sugar. As you begin to eat make sure to get a small piece of butter in each bite.</p><p>If making this recipe vegan or dairy-free be sure to use vegan and dairy-free milk and butter.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 4-6 servings</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 2m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 2m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 1h2m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1 cup arborio rice (risotto rice)</li><li>2 cups water</li><li>4 cups whole milk (or almond milk if making vegan)</li><li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li><li>1 vanilla bean</li><li>butter (1/2-1 tablespoon per person, vegan butter if making vegan)</li><li>cinnamon sugar (to taste)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> rice cooker or stock pot</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Place the <strong>rice</strong>, <strong>water</strong>, <strong>milk</strong> and <strong>salt</strong> in a rice cooker. Then split the <strong>vanilla bean</strong> down the middle and scrape the beans into the rice cooker then place the whole bean in there as well. Turn it on the white rice setting. Stir every 10 minutes just to make sure the bottom is not burning. Add more water as needed. *If making this in a stock pot you will have to keep a close eye on it so it does not boil over or burn so cook it over low heat. It is done when the rice is cooked through. It should be a little soupy, it is porridge after all.</li><li>If you are playing the game then take an almond, put it in a small bowl and pour boiling water over it. Wait a few minutes then fish it out of the bowl and the skin should slip right off. Put it into the serving bowl.</li><li>Scoop your serving of the porridge into a bowl, then make a small well in the middle of the porridge. Put a dab (about 1/2 tbsp) of <strong>butter</strong> into the well. Then sprinkle <strong>cinnamon sugar</strong> over the entire top.</li><li>This part is very important! Do not mix everything together! Your Norwegian friends will never forgive you. When you eat risengrynsgrøt you take your spoon and dig into part of the butter, then continue down into the porridge. You are meant to have a small piece of butter with every bite.</li></ol>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.wafflehearts.com/recipes/pepperkaker</guid><title>Pepperkaker</title><description>Traditional Norwegian Gingerbread Cookies</description><link>https://www.wafflehearts.com/recipes/pepperkaker</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Dec 2020 03:55:00 -0800</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Norway from December 1-31 pepperkaker is everywhere. Pepperkaker and gløgg to be more precise. When you go buy a Christmas tree there is a table with free pepperkaker and gløgg. When you go into shops there is a little bowl of pepperkaker by the door. When you go to see Nøtteknekkeren at the opera (and you must!) they have pint sized ballerinas handing it out at intermission. It wouldn’t be Christmas in Norway without pepperkaker. Most people make their own AND buy store bought. That’s because most of the recipes are not very good. Rolling out and stamping the cookies with kids is a tradition that everyone does. The kids even do it at school. I have never seen such adept bakers in my life as Norwegian toddlers rolling out and stamping their own gingerbread cookies. However, for the dough to be so workable by little hands it is often a bit tough and slightly too thick. So people usually buy the pepperkaker they want to eat. I now present you with the most delicious and totally workable recipe for pepperkaker! This dough rolls out beautifully, and it tastes amazing! The key is to get it thin enough and not burn it. Pepperkaker should have a snap to it.</p><p>Note: I don’t recommend this recipe for making gingerbread houses, it is a bit too soft to hold up for very long.</p><p>A note on substitutions: If you substitute honey for the corn syrup it makes the cookies softer. If you substitute gluten free flour these are easier to roll out but they are also softer. I have not found a butter substitute that is sufficient to make these completely dairy free, but you can replace the cream with soy milk without too much trouble.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> about 40 4inch gingerbread men</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 1h30m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 1h30m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 1h40m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>250 grams salted butter (a little over two sticks)</li><li>150 grams light corn syrup or allulose syrup</li><li>255 grams sugar</li><li>150 grams cream</li><li>580 grams all purpose flour</li><li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li><li>3/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li><li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li><li>2 teaspoon ground pepper</li><li>3 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> cookie cutters</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Combine the <strong>butter</strong>, <strong>corn syrup</strong> and <strong>sugar</strong> in a saucepan. Heat over medium until butter melts and sugar dissolves. Remove from heat.</li><li>Whisk the <strong>cream</strong> into the sugar mixture. Set aside.</li><li>In a large bowl sift the <strong>flour</strong>, <strong>baking powder</strong>, and <strong>spices</strong>.</li><li>Combine the wet and dry mixtures.</li><li>Stir with a wooden spoon until a smooth dough forms.</li><li>Divide into balls and wrap in parchment paper. Then tie with a rubber band. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</li><li>Preheat the oven to 350ºF/175ºC then roll out the dough, stamp shapes and bake. If the dough has gotten too cold then it will be tricky to roll out, we like to hit it with the rolling pin to flatten it (because it’s fun) then roll and turn a bunch of times. You can also take off smaller balls and warm them up in your hands and knead them a few times before rolling out. Use flour when rolling out and make sure to put down a little flour just after the last roll so that the cookies don’t stick to the counter after you’ve stamped them.</li><li>Bake small cookies (1-2") for 10 minutes. Bake large cookies (4-6") for 12-14 minutes. They are done baking when they start to change color at the edges, but are not too dark. It just takes buring one batch to know what too dark is :)...if they are not done in the suggested times then they are too thick.</li></ol><p>350ºF 10m - small cookies 12-14m - large cookies</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.wafflehearts.com/recipes/gloegg</guid><title>Gløgg</title><description>This is a non-alcoholic version of mulled wine enjoyed in Norway during the winter holidays.</description><link>https://www.wafflehearts.com/recipes/gloegg</link><pubDate>Fri, 4 Dec 2020 02:39:00 -0800</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kids across Norway LOVE gløgg.

You want to have roughly equal amounts of apples and pears. 10 of each fruit is an estimate! This will vary depending on the size of fruit and size of your slow cooker. You want to use as many fruits as you can and fill it as full as possible because it will cook down.</p><p>Make sure to use cooking apples (no gala, or red delicious). My favorite apples to cook with are Wagener, Hauer Pippin, Pink Lady or Granny Smith apples. You can use almost any kind of pear. The only pears that I’ve had a poor result with are D’anjou. Otherwise, Warren pears are our top pick. This needs to cook for about 14 hours and at some point it needs to be puréed with either a stick blender or in a blender/food processor. You can purée it anytime after about 2 hours in to 2 hours from the end.</p><p>The type of fruit you use and the ripeness of it will make this recipe more wet/dry. If it is more dry it will need to cook for less time, if it is more wet it will need to cook for more time. Cook it until it is the consistency you want it to be (ie. do you want it to be thick enough to spread on toast, or thinner to add to yogurt?) I’ve added 1 cup of water to the beginning of cooking to make sure that if you choose dry fruits they won’t burn. For example Granny Smith apples and Asian pears are dry, while Gravenstein apples and ripe Warren pears are juicy. It’s fun to play around with the different fruits to get the Apple Pear Butter that is perfect for you!</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 6-8 pints</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 45m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 45m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 14h45m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>10 apples (use a cooking apple like: Granny Smith, Gravensteins, Pink Lady, Wagener, etc.)</li><li>10 pears (Warren pears if you can get them, or Bartlett or Asian)</li><li>1 cup water</li><li>3 tablespoons Maple syrup (optional: use more or less if you want it sweeter or less sweet)</li><li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li><li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li><li>1/4 teaspoon ground clove</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Slice <strong>apples</strong> and <strong>pears</strong> into bite-sized pieces, discarding seeds, cores and stems. Leave on the skins. The skins have pectin, that is what gives this sauce thickness. Place the sliced apples and pears into slow cooker.</li><li>Add 1 cup of <strong>water</strong> to slow cooker.</li><li>Set the slow cooker on low for 14 hours.</li><li>At some point in the middle, after at least two hours but no later than 2 hours from the end you should purée the apples and pears with a stick blender or in a blender/food processor and return it to the slow cooker to finish cooking. This is also when you add the <strong>maple syrup</strong>, <strong>cinnamon</strong>, <strong>nutmeg</strong> and <strong>clove</strong>. Blend in the spices.</li><li>Around the 14 hour mark check the sauce for consistency. If you are happy with it you can turn it off and it is done! If you want it thicker, cook it uncovered for longer (up to several hours) until it is the consistency you want it to be. It will thicken up slightly as it cools, so to test it remove some and put it on a plate and let it cool.</li><li>Enjoy!</li></ol>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.wafflehearts.com/recipes/sungold_tomato_soup</guid><title>Sungold Tomato Soup</title><description>If you grow Sungold cherry tomatoes then you know how prolific this little plant can be.

If you have never grown them you should try! You can grow then from seed or starter plant. They are by far the easiest tomato I have ever grown and they produce a ton. Start by putting transplants deep into compost rich soil. Make sure they are evenly watered and that is about it. They will produce and produce and produce! We love these little cherry tomatoes so much that we stopped even trying to grow other kinds of cherry tomatoes so that we can have several Sungold plants instead.</p><p>I recommend making this soup to accompany grilled cheese sandwiches.

These three moms decide to get together to cook, never in the kitchen at the same time. Each tossing in ingredients while taking turns wrangling toddlers. Well this crazy mixed-up soup is the result. I would never have put garlic and ginger together in pumpkin soup but someone else did, and I'm really really glad they did. It might be my favorite new flavor combination!</p><p>When making this recipe remember to choose a cooking apple that retains its flavor after cooking. I’d recommend a Braburn, Jonagold, Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, Mutsu, Pippin or Pink Lady.</p><p>I’ve tested this recipe with both a fairytale pumpkin and a Kabocha squash. Both worked out perfectly.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 6 servings (about 3 quarts)</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 30m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 30m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 1h30m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>4 pound fairytale pumpkin (or Kabocha squash)</li><li>3 sweet potatoes (total of about 2.5 pounds)</li><li>1 yellow onion</li><li>1 large apple (cooking apple, see suggestions above)</li><li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger (about a thumb-sized piece)</li><li>4 large garlic cloves (at least)</li><li>2 cups vegetable stock (or bone broth if not making this vegetarian/vegan)</li><li>2 cups water</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> 2 jelly roll pans (rimmed baking sheets), large stockpot (at least 4 quart), immersion blender or regular blender</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Preheat oven to 425ºF/220ºC.</li><li>Cut the pumpkin in half and remove the seeds. Then place it cut-side-down onto a jelly roll pan. Do not use a cookie sheet for this; liquid is going to come out of the pumpkin and you need the rim to catch it. You can save this liquid and pour it into the soup or discard it.</li><li>Using a knife or fork poke holes in the sweet potatoes and place them in the second jelly roll pan.</li><li>Cut the onion in half and place it onto the pan with the potatoes. You do not need to peel it (yet).</li><li>Roast the pumpkin, potatoes and onion. They are ready when you can pierce the pumpkin and potatoes easily with a fork. Depending on the size of your pumpkin and potatoes, this could take 45-60 minutes. When they are ready, remove from the oven and set out to cool until you can handle the pumpkin to scoop out the flesh.</li><li>Scoop the pumpkin flesh into a large stockpot.</li><li>Break the sweet potatoes into multiple pieces and place in the stock pot.</li><li>Peel the dry layers off the onion and discard, place the soft parts into the stock pot.</li><li>Remove the apple core and chop the apple into 8-10 slices, add to the stock pot.</li><li>Add the ginger, garlic, vegetable stock and water to the stock pot.</li><li>Using an immersion blender puree the soup until smooth. If using a regular blender, blend in sections until you have pureed all of the soup. Depending on how thick you would like your soup you can add more water at this point.</li><li>Quickly bring the soup to a boil, then remove from heat. Cool slightly and enjoy!

However American pancakes are fluffy and light. These are truly fluffy pancakes. As long as you don't over-mix them. For goodness sake don’t over mix them!</p><p>You can mix up the dry ingredients ahead of time and they fit conveniently into a pint-sized mason jar. I like to make up a couple jars and keep them in the cupboard. That way whenever we want pancakes I just pull one out and add the wet ingredients. They keep for about 6 months.</p><p>This pancake recipe is adapted from Alton Brown’s cookbook “Good Eats The Early Years”.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 8-10 pancakes</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 20m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 20m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 50m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>9.3 ounces all purpose flour</li><li>1 teaspoon coarse salt</li><li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li><li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li><li>0.3 ounces granulated sugar</li><li>1 tablespoon wheat germ</li><li>1 tablespoon ground flax seeds</li><li>1 cup Greek yogurt (you can use fat-free or full-fat)</li><li>1 cup milk or unsweetened milk substitute (I like to use almond milk)</li><li>2 large organic eggs</li><li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li><li>2 tablespoons butter (melted and cooled slightly)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> kitchen scale, 2 large bowls</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>In a large bowl whisk together the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, wheat germ and flax seed.</li><li>In a separate bowl mix the Greek yogurt, milk, eggs and vanilla until smooth. Then slowly drizzle in the butter while whisking to temper the batter so the eggs don’t cook prematurely.</li><li>Dump the dry mixture onto the wet mixture and with a fork, wooden spoon or pancake whisk, stir about 30 times. Then stop. There will be lumps. It’s ok. Let the batter sit for 10 minutes to swell. It should be nice and thick.</li><li>Heat a griddle or non-stick pan. If using a griddle, grease it with a little butter.</li><li>Ladle one pancake at a time. Cooking time will depend on how large you make them. Once you can see little bubbles forming around the edges and in the center you can use a pancake turner to check the bottom. Once they are golden brown flip them over and cook a couple of minutes on the other side until cooked all the way through and golden brown on the outside.</li><li>Serve warm with fresh fruit, plain yogurt, strawberry jam, pear butter, and toasted almonds and coconut.</li></ol>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.wafflehearts.com/recipes/jens_mango_pico</guid><title>Jen’s Mango Pico</title><description>Nothing says summer quite like juicy, red tomatoes, pineapple, mango and fresh herbs!

I have added some extra ingredients to help increase breastmilk production. There are a lot of lactation ingredients in this bread including: oatmeal, eggs, cinnamon, almonds, pecans, flax and coconut!</p><p><em>Note about oat flour</em> In the instructions I tell you how to make the oat flour using a blender and rolled oats. It is very easy to do and the best option if you are making this recipe gluten-free. Alternatively you can buy oat flour as is, but it is difficult to find gluten-free oat flour. Oats and oat flour is naturally gluten-free but it is usually processed on the same machines as grains that contain gluten so there can be cross contamination unless you buy oats that are sold as “gluten-free”. Bob’s Red Mill is one company that offers gluten-free oats.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 1 loaf, 20 muffins, 48 mini-muffins</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 20m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 20m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 1h10m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>6 ripe bananas ((medium-large))</li><li>1/2 cup plain applesauce</li><li>2 organic eggs</li><li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li><li>1 teaspoon almond extract</li><li>12 ounces rolled oats (or oat flour - if making this recipe gluten-free make sure to get gluten-free rolled oats)</li><li>2 tablespoons ground flax seeds</li><li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li><li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li><li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li><li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg</li><li>1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt</li><li>1 cup sliced almonds or pecans (or both)</li><li>1/2 cup unsweetened shredded coconut</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> large bowl, medium bowl, blender, scale, baking vessel of your choice</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Preheat the oven to 350ºF/180ºC and prepare your baking vessel (e.g. loaf pan, muffin cups)</li><li>In a large bowl mash the bananas with a fork until all the chunks are gone. You can either use a fork or a potato masher. Then mix in the applesauce, eggs, vanilla and almond extracts. Set aside.</li><li>If using rolled oats, place them into a blender or food processor and puree until all of the oats are completely chopped up and resemble flour. Now you have oat flour. Depending on your blender you may want to only blend 4 ounces at a time. Do not over blend or the oats will get gummy.</li><li>Place the oat flour into a medium-sized bowl. Then add the baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt and sift these dry ingredients together.</li><li>Stir the dry mixture into the wet mixture about 1/2 cup at a time until it is all incorporated.</li><li>Fold in the nuts. Then you can either fold in the coconut, or sprinkle it on top of the loaf.</li><li>Pour the batter into prepared loaf pan, muffin cups or mini-muffin cups.</li><li>Bake at 350ºF/180ºC until a toothpick inserted in comes out clean. This should be about 45-50 minutes for a loaf, 27-32 minutes as muffins, or 18-20 minutes as mini muffins.</li><li>Eat as is, or top with almond butter for a extra lactation boost.</li></ol>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.wafflehearts.com/recipes/annes_messed-with_meatloaf</guid><title>Anne’s Messed-With Meatloaf</title><description>Surely you have heard of turkey-loaf, lentil-loaf and traditional beef meatloaf, but have you ever had bison meatloaf?

It is the quintessential American meal. So why mess with it? But then I realized that if I didn’t mess with it then what is the point of putting it online and adding to the already hundreds of traditional meatloaf recipes in the universe. So I give you Anne’s Messed-With Meatloaf. Don’t worry. It is way better than lentil loaf. Plus, if you happen to be a breastfeeding mom (like me) this is a great recipe for breastmilk production because it has whole oats, carrot, broccoli cauliflower, flax, onion and garlic…all of which are lactogenic foods!</p><p>Note: To make things easier you can purchase the carrot, broccoli and cauliflower pre-chopped and frozen. It is often called “California Mix”.

Unfortunately certain members of my family (not to be named) refuse to eat key ingredients in the stuffing that I grew up with and love (my mom’s recipe) which is why I have this dilemma. Finally, after piecing together bits of my mom’s stuffing with several others we have tried over the years this dish has finally emerged. The apples give it a great tart/sweet flavor while the pecans add an irresistible nutty crunch. I have made it for two years in a row now with not a single complaint, and in fact many compliments, so I feel it is finally ready to share.</p><p>Stuffing in name only this recipe is actually baked in a medium-sized baking dish in the oven…not in a turkey.

I prefer to eat vegetarian meals, especially when eating out but the problem is nearly every restaurant thinks that either cheese or tofu is what makes a dish vegetarian. Whenever the waiter asks if I would like chicken or shrimp, I always say, “No thank you”. To which they respond, “Oh so you would like tofu”….”um no”. Then when I ask if I can just have extra veggies instead of tofu, They get a confused look and mutter, “Oh, ok”. Really? Are vegetables so far removed from our minds that tofu seems more natural? That’s enough vegetarian ranting for now…please enjoy this tofu-free vegetarian pad thai and don’t be afraid to ask for extra veggies the next time you’re at a restaurant.</p><p>An easy alternative to making this dish would be to just chop up 6 cups worth of whatever vegetables you have on hand, sauté them in avocado or olive oil until tender, then mix in the sauce and serve with rice.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 2-3 servings</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 20m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 20m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 40m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>4 ounces brown rice noodles</li><li>1 tablespoon avocado oil</li><li>1 red bell pepper (cored, deseeded and julienned)</li><li>1 carrot (peeled and julienned)</li><li>1 zucchini (julienned)</li><li>8 Brussels sprouts (remove the woody end and slice)</li><li>3 spring onions (sliced, white and green parts separated)</li><li>2 teaspoons freshly grated ginger</li><li>3 eggs (omit if making this vegan)</li><li>1 cup bean sprouts</li><li>2 cups fresh spinach</li><li>2 tablespoons peanuts (crushed or ground)</li><li>1 lime (cut into quarters)</li><li>1 1/4 cups pad thai sauce (see link below for the recipe)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> wok or wide skillet with a tall lip, large bowl</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Make or buy the <a href="https://wafflehearts.com/recipes/pad_thai_sauce/">Pad Thai Sauce</a></li><li>Cook the brown rice noodles according to the package directions.

Then sauté the bell pepper, carrot, zucchini, Brussels sprouts, white parts of the green onion, and ginger for 8-12 minutes until the veggies soften.

Then just yesterday I got an email from my mom asking me for the recipe because grandma wanted to make it for herself! I wish there was a way that I could make some and mail it to her but until teleportation becomes reasonably priced I’ll have to settle for her making her own. Luckily it’s a pretty simple recipe that only takes about 20 minutes and you can easily double or triple it and freeze the excess.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> about 1.5 liters (6.5 cups)</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 10m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 10m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 22m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1 large carrot</li><li>1 medium zucchini</li><li>2 celery stalks</li><li>1 cup frozen spinach (or 4 cups chopped fresh spinach)</li><li>3 cups cooked black beans (or 2 15oz cans, drained and rinsed)</li><li>1/2 cup organic frozen corn (you can also use fresh corn, but avoid canned)</li><li>3 cups vegetable stock</li><li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li><li>1/2 teaspoon garlic granules</li><li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li><li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li><li>1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper (optional)</li><li>salt and pepper (to taste)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> 2-liter saucepan or larger, blender</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Mince the carrot, zucchini and celery.

I also removed the tofu, I just don’t understand tofu and I really don’t like how processed it is. Don’t get me started on my tofu rant! If you really want to know you can email me. Meanwhile, enjoy this delicious, veggie-rich soup that is full of stomach cleansing probiotics and whole foods.</p><p>Note: This recipe uses miso paste which is made by fermenting a mixture of soybeans, barley and brown rice. It is a probiotic food that contains microorganisms that are great for your digestive system. If you have never used miso paste before then mellow white miso is a great one to start with. It has the most mild flavor because it is the least fermented. The delicate flavor works great in light recipes like this, however there are few things you need to be careful about when cooking with miso paste. It should always be added at the end of a recipe once the food is at serving temperature and never heated over high heat because this could kill the beneficial microorganisms. Since it is made with soybeans you should make sure to buy either organic or non-GMO paste in the refrigerated section, usually wherever the tofu is located. If making this recipe gluten-free make sure to buy gluten-free miso and tamari.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 6 cups</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 20m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 20m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 40m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>2 leeks</li><li>10-15 shiitake mushrooms</li><li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil</li><li>2 garlic cloves (chopped or minced)</li><li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li><li>1 large carrot (chopped into bite-sized pieces)</li><li>2 celery stalks (chopped into bite-sized pieces)</li><li>1 red bell pepper (cored, seeded and thinly sliced)</li><li>1 teaspoon organic tamari</li><li>4 cups vegetable stock</li><li>1 lemongrass stalk</li><li>3 spring onions (white and light green parts thinly sliced)</li><li>2 tablespoons non-GMO miso paste (make sure to buy gluten-free miso if making this recipe gluten-free)</li><li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> 2 quart saucepan or larger</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Thinly chop and wash the leeks.

They are grown in sandy soil so this allows the sand to fall to the bottom of the bowl, while the mushrooms float at the top. Remove the mushrooms and dry them on paper towels then trim the stems and thinly slice.</li><li>Heat the toasted sesame oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.</li><li>Sauté the mushrooms, garlic and ginger until the garlic starts to brown and the mushrooms release their juices (about 5 minutes). Use a slotted spoon to remove these to a bowl temporarily.</li><li>Now sauté the leeks, carrot, celery, and bell pepper until they begin to sweat and soften (8-10 minutes).</li><li>Add the mushroom mixture back to the pan along with the tamari and vegetables stock.</li><li>Bruise the lemongrass stock with the back of a knife, then cut it into 3 pieces and add it to the soup.</li><li>Simmer the soup for 5 minutes then remove from heat. Remove the lemongrass pieces. Stir in the spring onions, miso and cilantro and either serve warm or refrigerate for up to a week. When reheating this soup be sure not to boil it or you could kill the beneficial microorganisms in the miso. If you plan to make this soup to serve at a later date you might consider not adding the miso until you are ready to serve it.</li></ol>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.wafflehearts.com/recipes/leek_and_parsnip_soup</guid><title>Leek &amp; Parsnip Soup</title><description>There’s something sophisticated yet unpretentious about leeks and parsnips that I can’t really explain.

You can even make a meal out of it by adding a small salad. So make up a big batch, keep it in the fridge for up to a week and have a cup or two anytime you need a quick pick-me-up!</p><p>Note: This recipe uses miso paste which is made by fermenting a mixture of soybeans, barley and brown rice.

Scrape any stuck bits off the bottom of the pan and continue to boil for a few minutes. You are basically doing this to burn off the alcohol. There’s some argument over how long this actually takes, basically the longer you boil it, but more alcohol is burnt off but you can never burn off all of it. Just keep in mind the longer you boil it the more it will reduce so you will need to add vegetable stock accordingly.</li><li>Add the vegetable stock to the wine and bring to a boil then pour these into a blender along with the oregano and nutmeg. Purée on high until smooth. Test out the thickness and add more vegetable stock if desired to thin it out.</li><li>Once you are happy with the thickness add the mellow white miso and blend again.

When regarding citrus, it is the cooking term used to describe the process of segmenting a citrus fruit by cutting away the skin, pith, membranes and seeds. It is a technique that is fairly easy to master after a few tries and will certainly boost your confidence in the kitchen! It also makes any dishes with citrus instantly more attractive. I find that grapefruit in particular is much better when suprémed because the membranes tend to be quite thick and chewy. In this example I have used a grapefruit, but this technique works for any citrus fruit: oranges, lemons, limes, pomelos, etc.</p><p>An absolute must to supréming citrus is to use a serrated knife. You can do this with a non-serrated knife if the knife is VERY sharp but it still isn’t as good as using a serrated knife.</p><p>How to use suprémed fruit: - fruit salad - orange chicken/fish - grapefruit with cottage cheese - any regular salad that has citrus in it</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> lovely citrus fruit segments</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 5m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 5m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 5m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> serrated knife</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Using a serrated knife cut the top and bottom off so that you have flat sides on either end of the grapefruit.</li><li>Place the grapefruit flat side down and slice from the top downward curving your knife as you go so that you cut off the skin while removing as little flesh as possible.</li><li>Continue to slice all of the skin off in this fashion. You may want to flip the grapefruit over and slice from the opposite end to make sure all of the skin and exterior pith is removed.</li><li>Now you should be able to see the membrane lines that run from vertically from the top to bottom of the grapefruit. Hold the grapefruit in your hand and carefully slice just to the right of one of these lines. Cut toward the center of the fruit. Then remove the knife and find the line just to the right of where you made the first cut. Now cut to the left of that line toward the center of the fruit. The grapefruit segment should fall out easily.</li><li>Continue to slice in this way on either side of each segment line until you have removed all of the grapefruit flesh. Discard the pith, membranes and any seeds that may be attached to the flesh. You should be left with a lovely collection of grapefruit segments that can be used in any way you like. If it took you forever to get to this point, don’t worry. You will get faster at it until one day it takes you no time at all.</li></ol>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.wafflehearts.com/recipes/classic_coleslaw</guid><title>Classic Coleslaw</title><description>This classic mixture of cabbage, carrot, onion, mayonnaise and vinegar makes a great accompaniment to roasted potatoes and anything covered in BBQ sauce.

These instructions are for those who want wheatgrass juice but don’t have a juicer and don't want to pay the high price of getting it freshly squeezed or buying pre-made frozen cubes for $1+ per ounce. The wheatgrass juice produced with the following instructions is less concentrated than pure pressed wheatgrass because you have to water it down to blend it. With pressed wheatgrass 1 ounce is the recommend serving size, however made this way I would say that 2 ounces (1/4 cup) is better estimate.</p><p>Wheatgrass juice doesn’t stay fresh for long so to get the most nutrients out of it I recommend blending as needed and consuming right away or immediately freezing it into cubes for later use. Most people don’t say what the time limit is but I have seen some estimates say that it only stays fresh for about 30 minutes.</p><p>You can either acquire wheatgrass either at your local health food store, or farmers market, or you can grow your own (see link below). Wheatgrass is probably the easiest thing you will ever attempt to grow, and one of the most cost effective. It will grow in any container in nearly any climate or lighting condition and is ready to harvest in 7 days. If you are buying wheatgrass at the store, chances are the smallest amount you can get is 1 pound (about 12 cups). That’s a LOT of wheatgrass. Since it is best consumed fresh you should leave it in grass form until ready to drink or freeze. I like to blend big batches and freeze them into ice cubes right away.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 4 servings</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 5m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 5m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 5m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> blender, nut milk bag or cheese cloth</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Place the wheatgrass into a blender in equal parts i.e. 1 cup wheatgrass/1 cup water, or 1/2 cup wheatgrass/1/2 cup water, etc. Blend on high until all of the wheatgrass is well blended.</li><li>Place a nut milk bag or cheese cloth over a cup or bowl the appropriate size for the amount of juice you made. Then slowly pour the liquid through the bag into the container. This strains off all of the indigestible wheatgrass fibers. (If you are putting the wheatgrass into a smoothie you can skip this step. The fibers are indigestible - similar to the casing on corn kernels - but they not bad for you).</li><li>Immediately drink or freeze.</li></ol>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.wafflehearts.com/recipes/basias_disappearing_deviled_eggs</guid><title>Basia’s Disappearing Deviled Eggs</title><description>This recipe comes from a family friend who has been requested to make them for many get togethers.

It comes from my best friend’s mom. She's an adorable little Polish woman who is an amazing cook. She is actually the one who taught me that it is possible to make mashed potatoes that don’t come from a box! But back to the eggs. I made these for my husband’s 30th birthday party for a crowd of deviled egg connoisseurs. Well I made the filling, and someone else boiled the eggs. We mixed the egg yolks and filling together but by the time I realized what had happened it was too late. I had made enough filling for 24 eggs and she had only boiled 12! So we ended up with double strength deviled eggs…which turned out to be a huge hit! They disappeared within 10 minutes and everyone who got one loved them. We even had some comments along the lines of “best deviled eggs they'd ever had” and lots of people asking for the recipe. For those of you who have been waiting for it, here it is. Enjoy! Feel free to make these as written or cut the ingredients (except the eggs) in half and make them like Basia does. If you make them as written they really have a kick. Basia's way is a bit milder.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 6 deviled eggs (12 halves)</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 10m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 10m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 22m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>6 organic eggs</li><li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li><li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li><li>4 teaspoons prepared horseradish</li><li>1 teaspoon dry mustard powder</li><li>salt and pepper (to taste)</li><li>paprika (garnish)</li><li>fresh chives (garnish)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> medium-large saucepan, large bowl, medium bowl, sifter (optional), piping bag and tip (optional)</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Fill a medium to large saucepan with enough water to cover all of the <strong>eggs</strong> by at least an inch. With just water in the pan bring the water to a boil over high heat.</li><li>Pierce a small hole in the bottom of each egg with a sterilized pin. Then gently place the eggs into the boiling water. Boil for 12-14 minutes (depending on the size of the eggs), set a timer so you don’t overcook them.</li><li>Fill a large bowl with ice cold water.</li><li>When the timer goes off on the eggs use a slotted spoon to remove them from the boiling water and immediately immerse them in the cold water.</li><li>Once the eggs are cool (about 10 minutes) peel them and discard the shells.</li><li>Slice the eggs in half lengthwise and put the yolks into a medium bowl. Set the eggs whites into a storage or serving container (depending on if you are serving right away or storing for later).</li><li>Use a fork to mash the yolks. To make the filling smooth enough to put through a piping bag you should mash the yolks through a mesh strainer. This will remove the lumps.</li><li>Add the <strong>mayonnaise</strong>, <strong>vinegar</strong>, <strong>horseradish</strong> and <strong>dry mustard powder</strong> to the medium bowl. Mix well, then season to taste with <strong>salt</strong> and <strong>pepper</strong>.</li><li>Place the filling into a piping bag with a decorate tip. If you are storing these for later you can store the filling in the piping bag. Just before serving, place the eggs whites in a serving dish, then pipe some filling into each one.

I have been fortunate enough to have eaten ragù alla bolognese in the town of its origin, Bologna, Italy, and it is one of my most cherished memories. I love making this delicious dish and reminiscing about my time in Italy, a country in love with good food.</p><p>Bolognese is a meat-based sauce, usually used in lasagna or to top tagliatelle. Traditionally this dish is made with a soffritto (sautéed onion, celery and carrot). I have added several extra veggies to this mixture including zucchini and spinach. You can use any type of pasta with this sauce, my favorite is orecchiette.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 4 cups (2 servings)</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 20m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 20m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 50m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1/2 small onion</li><li>1 celery stalk</li><li>1 carrot (peeled)</li><li>1 zucchini</li><li>2 teaspoons coconut oil</li><li>1 pound ground bison</li><li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li><li>1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary</li><li>dash freshly ground nutmeg</li><li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li><li>2 cups crushed tomatoes (you can buy whole, chopped or diced tomatoes and whip them up in the blender for a few seconds)</li><li>1 teaspoon double concentrated tomato paste</li><li>1/2 cup frozen spinach (or 2 1/2 cups packed fresh spinach)</li><li>salt and pepper (to taste)</li><li>4 ounces whole grain pasta (gluten-free pasta, or paleo pasta if desired)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> food processor or blender, 2 bowls, 2-quart saucepan or skillet with a tall lip</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Peel and core the onion, then slice into chunks. Working in small (1-2 cup batches) place the <strong>onion</strong> into a food processor or blender. Blend on a low setting until the pieces are minced (a size that resembles the ground beef texture). Remove the minced onion mixture to a bowl.</li><li>Roughly chop the <strong>celery</strong>, <strong>carrot</strong> and <strong>zucchini</strong>. Working again in small batches, blend the celery, carrot and zucchini together on a low setting until it is minced. It helps to have a little of each vegetable in each batch that is being chopped. Remove the chopped veggies to a second bowl, keeping them separate from the onion mixture.</li><li>Heat the coconut oil in a 2-quart saucepan or skillet over medium heat. Then add the <strong>onion</strong>.

A few years ago I was staying in a hostel in Denmark and had this very problem. It had been about 2 weeks of eating out for every meal, and while the food had all been delicious sometimes you just want a homemade meal. We were lucky enough to have access to a small kitchen with one or two pans so we knew we could at least boil water for pasta. After stopping by a little corner shop, we whipped up this dish in no time at all. We ate some of it right away and put the rest in the fridge for later. It tasted just as good hot as it did cold the next day!</p><p>You can use any kind of pasta for this recipe. If you don’t have a kitchen scale to weight out the pasta, you can use the following volume measures. These are for approximately 2 servings. - Elbow macaroni or similar size - 1 cup - Penne or similar size - 1.5 cups - Egg noodles or similar size - 2.5 cups</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 2 servings</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 10m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 10m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 20m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>4 ounces uncooked pasta (see note above for volume measurements)</li><li>1 cup peas</li><li>1 cup chopped broccoli</li><li>1/4 pound smoked salmon</li><li>1/4 cup fat-free Greek yogurt</li><li>1 tablespoon fresh dill</li><li>salt and pepper (to taste)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> saucepan</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Cook the <strong>pasta</strong> according to the package directions.</li><li>About 3 minutes before the pasta is finished cooking, toss the <strong>peas</strong> and <strong>broccoli</strong> into the boiling water with pasta.

You can easily customize them by adding cheese or meat to some while leaving others dairy-free and vegetarian. You can also make a bunch of these at the beginning of the week and reheat them as needed for a quick breakfast or snack.</p><p>I recommend using a greased muffin tin, but if you prefer you can try paper muffin cups. I must warn you that every time I tried muffin cups the paper stuck to the quiches because there’s not enough fat in them. You can also use silicon cupcake molds, which work great and you don't have to grease them!</p><p>Tip: When buying frozen spinach try to buy it in a bag not a box. The boxed is more difficult to use because the entire block must be defrosted in order to use. Bagged spinach can be used as needed.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 12 mini quiches</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 10m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 10m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 30m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1 large carrot</li><li>1 large zucchini</li><li>1 small shallot</li><li>6 organic eggs</li><li>3 tablespoons unsweetened milk substitute (unsweetened coconut, soy, almond, etc)</li><li>1/2 teaspoon fine salt</li><li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li><li>1 teaspoon you favorite dried herb (rosemary, oregano, etc.)</li><li>1/2 cup frozen chopped spinach</li><li>1 tablespoon avocado oil (plus more to grease the baking dish)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> skillet, muffin tin or silicon cupcake molds</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Preheat oven to 425ºF/220ºC, and prepare your muffin tin/silicon cupcake molds. If using silicon molds you might not have to use any oil, muffin tins will require just a bit. I recommend avocado oil as olive oil should not be heated over 400ºF.</li><li>Dice the carrot, zucchini and shallot.</li><li>Heat the avocado oil in a skillet over medium heat. Sweat the chopped carrot, zucchini and shallot for about 5-10 minutes until they soften up a bit. Then remove from heat and let them cool for a couple of minutes while you get the eggs ready.</li><li>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk substitute, spinach, salt, pepper and any dried herbs you would like to use. The dried herbs are optional. I like to combine a half teaspoon of rosemary and a half teaspoon of oregano.</li><li>Add the sautéed veggies to the bowl with the eggs and stir the ingredients together.</li><li>Pour a little of the egg mixture into each muffin cup. You want to leave about a 1/2 inch of space for each one because the quiches will rise; you don’t want them to spill over the edge of the tin.</li><li>Bake at 425ºF/220ºC for 20-22 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean. You just need to cook them long enough so the eggs are cooked through.</li><li>Remove the muffin tin from the oven and use a spatula to loosen the quiches from the sides of the pan, then carefully scoop them out onto a wire rack.</li><li>Eat while warm or refrigerate and heat them up one and a time as needed. They will keep in the fridge for up to a week.</li></ol>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.wafflehearts.com/recipes/eggplant_alla_pecorino</guid><title>Eggplant alla Pecorino</title><description>Roasted eggplant in a rich tomato sauce served with whole grain (or gluten-free) pasta and fresh spinach!</description><link>https://www.wafflehearts.com/recipes/eggplant_alla_pecorino</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2014 00:11:00 -0800</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Normally a dish like this is called eggplant Parmesan but I prefer to use Pecorino Romano. This cheese is similar to Parmesan, the main difference being that it is made from sheep’s milk instead of cow’s milk. If you are a strict vegetarian then keep in mind that Pecorino Romano is made using rennet. I have not yet found any pecorino made with vegetarian rennet, but I do know that Organic Valley makes a vegetarian Parmesan that you can use in this recipe instead of the pecorino. You don't need to worry as much about the mozzarella; most mozzarellas are rennet free but it's worth double checking the package if you are concerned.</p><p>Make sure to plan plenty of time for this dish to cook and cool.

Then rinse off the salt in cold water and gently squeeze out any excess liquid. I usually place the squeezed pieces onto paper towels while I work my way through them just to make sure all excess liquid is gone.</li><li>Meanwhile make the sauce: place the tomatoes, garlic cloves and oregano into a blender or food processor and blend on high until smooth.

Dry wines like chardonnays or dry vermouth work best. You can make this dish using shrimp with tails on or off. Tails-off is certainly easier to eat, but keep in mind that leaving the tails on adds a lot of flavor to the sauce.</p><p>Special dietary restrictions: Gluten-free: serve with rice or gluten-free pasta (not regular pasta or bread) Paleo: serve with steamed veggies, (not rice, pasta or bread)</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 2 servings</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 10m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 10m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 20m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li><li>5 garlic cloves (minced or pressed)</li><li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li><li>1/2 pound large raw shrimp (cleaned and deveined, tails on)</li><li>1/2 cup dry white wine (or vermouth)</li><li>1-2 teaspoons capers</li><li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li><li>3-4 cups hearty greens (chard/collard greens/kale/spinach/etc)</li><li>salt and pepper (to taste)</li><li>1 lemon</li><li>prepared rice, pasta, or crusty bread (see notes above about dietary restrictions)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> skillet, large bowl</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>If serving this dish with pasta or rice you will want to have that started already.</li><li>Heat the <strong>olive oil</strong> in a skillet over medium heat.</li><li>Sauté the <strong>garlic</strong> and <strong>oregano</strong> over medium heat until the garlic starts to brown (3-5minutes).</li><li>Add the <strong>shrimp</strong>, then the <strong>wine</strong> and <strong>capers</strong>.</li><li>Cook for 3-4 minutes on one side then flip them over halfway through cooking to make sure both sides are evenly done.</li><li>Once the shrimp are cooked through, remove them from the heat and add the chopped <strong>parsley</strong>.</li><li>Place the <strong>greens</strong> in a large bowl then tip the entire contents of the skillet onto the greens.

I tested this recipe with both dried and fresh figs. Everyone who tried it preferred the dried figs which is actually great news because it means you can enjoy it any time of year, not just during fig season!</p><p>We had them as an appetizer along with some fresh fruit and cheese, but these can easily be served as a dessert alone or as a topping for ice cream or cake.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 4-6 servings</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 5m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 5m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 1h5m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1 vanilla bean</li><li>1 cinnamon stick</li><li>6 whole cloves</li><li>1 750ml bottle port</li><li>12 dried black figs</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> saucepan</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Slice the <strong>vanilla bean</strong> in half lengthwise, then scrape out the seeds.

In some cultures it must be made with beef broth, while in others it’s strictly vegetarian, sometimes it is made with dill, occasionally it has tomato paste and it is almost always served with sour cream on top.</p><p>My own introduction to this bright red soup was Christmas eve dinner in Poland. A clear salty-sour broth with ravioli type dumplings; I was instantly in love! It was one of the most memorable meals I have ever had. It could have been the fact that every other dish that night involved some sort of pickled herring but I believe it was the discovery of what the polish call barszcz.</p><p>My own version of borscht is unique in that it uses pumpkin puree and Brussels sprouts instead of cabbage. It is also not topped with sour cream because I wanted to keep it vegan. Feel free to add sour cream to yours, but I think you’ll find it unnecessary.

Spaghetti squash is great because it’s so unique! The flesh comes out in spaghetti-like strings, which makes it a great replacement for pasta noodles in all of your favorite spaghetti recipes.</p><p>As someone who normally cooks for only 1 or 2 people I am used to looking for ingredients to accommodate smaller recipes. One of these is squashes and pumpkins. I always buy small squashes when I see them because often times later in the season they are hard to find. If you can not find a spaghetti squash under 1 pound, it is fine to use a larger one, but you won’t need all of the flesh. Just use as much as you need for this recipe (about 1 cup per person) then refrigerate the rest for use in another dish. It also may take a bit longer to cook. See cooking instructions below.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 2 servings</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 20m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 20m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 50m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1 small spaghetti squash (1 pound or less)</li><li>2 cups diced tomatoes</li><li>2 cups frozen spinach (no need to defrost)</li><li>2 cups chopped vegetables (any mixture of zucchini, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, Brussels sprouts)</li><li>1 1/2 cups water</li><li>1/2 cup dry green lentils</li><li>1 teaspoons dried oregano</li><li>1 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes (optional)</li><li>1 teaspoon dried minced onion</li><li>1 teaspoon garlic granules</li><li>1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary</li><li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li><li>fresh parsley (garnish)</li><li>salt and pepper (to taste)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> baking dish, large saucepan</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Preheat the oven to 425ºF/220ºC. Chop the ends off the <strong>spaghetti squash</strong> and cut in half lengthwise. Place the two halves cut side down in a baking dish and cook until you can easily pierce the side with a fork. This should take about 30 minutes.</li><li>Place the <strong>diced tomatoes</strong>, <strong>frozen spinach</strong>, <strong>chopped vegetables</strong>, <strong>water</strong>, <strong>lentils</strong>, <strong>dried oregano</strong>, dried <strong>red pepper flakes</strong>, <strong>dried minced onion</strong>, <strong>garlic powder</strong>, <strong>rosemary</strong> and <strong>paprika</strong> into a large saucepan. Cover and bring to a boil. Then reduce heat and simmer until the lentils are tender. This should take about 30 minutes. Make sure to keep an eye on the water level so it doesn’t burn. The vegetables will give off some water as the cook down and the lentils will absorb a lot of the water so it should work out well. If it is starting to look too dry and the lentils aren’t done yet just add more water 1/4 cup at a time. If the lentils are finished cooking and the sauce is too watery, just remove the lid and turn up the heat to boil off the extra liquid.</li><li><strong>Salt</strong> and <strong>pepper</strong> to taste.</li><li>Remove the squash from the oven and let cool for a few minutes. Then use a fork to scrape out the “spaghetti” by dragging it along the cut surface of the squash. You will notice that the flesh starts to form into strings. Continue until you have removed all of it. Discard the shell.</li><li>Serve the sauce atop the squash and garnish with fresh <strong>parsley</strong>.</li></ol>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.wafflehearts.com/howto/how_to_cook_spaghetti_squash</guid><title>How To: Cook Spaghetti Squash</title><description>Spaghetti Squash is one of the most unique gourds because the flesh is naturally stringy and spaghetti-like. Use it in soups, salads, or like its namesake: with spaghetti sauce.</description><link>https://www.wafflehearts.com/howto/how_to_cook_spaghetti_squash</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2013 19:12:00 -0800</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I will never forget the first time I had this unique gourd. I was having spaghetti for dinner at a friends house and I told her mom how much I liked the noodles she used. That is when she revealed that they weren’t noodles at all, but squash. If you have not yet discovered the wonders of spaghetti squash then prepare to be amazed. This cool squash has stringy flesh that looks exactly like spaghetti noodles! You can use it in soups, salads, as a side dish, etc. But, of course, the most popular way to use it is to replace spaghetti noodles and impress your guests.</p><p>Spaghetti squash can easily be cooked at any temperature between 350-425ºF/175-220ºC. I like to cook it at 425ºF/220ºC because I’m normally roasting other veggies at the same time and this is a great temperature to roast vegetables at. The temperature and size of the squash will change the cooking time, so all you really need to do is bake it until you can easily piece the skin with a fork, while keeping if from burning. These squashes usually come in 1-4 pound sizes. A 2-pound squash will take about 50 minutes at 375ºF/190ºC or 30 minutes at 425ºF/220ºC. If you are not sure what a spaghetti squash looks like see the photo below.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 4-8 servings</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 5m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 5m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 35m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> roasting dish</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Preheat oven to 425ºF/220ºC or desired temp (see note above).</li><li>Trim off the ends and cut the squash in half lengthwise.</li><li>Spoon out the seeds and discard. You want to get rid of the darker yellow stringy bits that are attached to the seeds but be careful not to scoop out the flesh, this is what you will be eating later.</li><li>Place the two halves cut-side down into a roast dish large enough to hold them.</li><li>Bake in the center of the oven until you can easily pierce the squash with a fork. Depending on the size of the squash this can take anywhere from 30-60 minutes.</li><li>Remove from the oven and let cool for a few minutes, just long enough so you don’t burn yourself trying to get the flesh out.</li><li>Use a fork to scrape out the “spaghetti” by dragging it along the cut surface of the squash. You will notice that the flesh starts to form into strings. Continue until you have removed all of it.

The longer you cook it the sweeter it gets, and the thicker it gets. I like to cook it for 16 hours, this produces a good consistency pear butter that is just sweet enough. However, you can cook it for anywhere from 14-18 hours.

The great thing about this recipes is you can have it hot or cold, so it’s perfect any time of year...as long as you like cinnamon.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 2 cups (4 servings)</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 5m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 5m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 10m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1/4 cup granulated sugar (or 4 dates, but you must have a powerful blender like a Vitamix otherwise it will end up lumpy)</li><li>1 1/2 cups unsweetened almond milk</li><li>1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li><li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li><li>1/2 teaspoon almond extract</li><li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li><li>1/4 cup sliced almonds</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> blender, saucepan</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Put all of the ingredients into a blender and blend on high until combined. (If you have a Vitamix you can leave the blender running until the mixture thickens - about 5 minutes - and skip to step 3, otherwise continue to step 2).</li><li>Pour the mixture into a saucepan and cook over medium-high heat until the mixture reaches the desired thickness. Stir constantly to keep it from burning or getting lumpy. This will also allow you to see how thick it is. Remove it from the heat as soon as it is the thickness you want otherwise it will get lumpy. If you are using cold milk this may take up to 10 minutes, but will probably only take about 5. It will bubble up a bit.

After testing out numerous squashes and fillings, the following recipe is my favorite combination. I find that the Kabocha Squash and Golden Nugget Squash have a wonderfully creamy texture that works perfectly for this dish. Feel free to use a different kind of pumpkin/squash and whatever filling you like or have on hand. This recipe is for one main course serving and it is very filling! If you want to have this as an appetizer or a less filling main course, then I recommend getting a squash that is less than 2 pounds. This is hard to do with a Kabocha, but you can often find Golden Nuggets that are smaller than 2 pounds.</p><p>While the squash is cooking you can toast the seeds and either sprinkle them on top of the soup as garnish or eat alone as an appetizer. See the link at the bottom for an easy recipe for toasted pumpkin seeds.</p><p>Note: If making this dish Paleo just leave out the legumes or replace them with cooked ground meat.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 1 large serving</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 10m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 10m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 1h10m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1/4 cup diced carrots</li><li>1 Kabocha squash (about 2 pounds)</li><li>1 cup vegetable stock</li><li>1/4 cup sliced black olives</li><li>1/4 cup halved pecans</li><li>1/4 cup cooked green lentils (or beans/if making this Paleo leave out the legumes)</li><li>1/4 cup diced celery</li><li>1/2 teaspoon dried sage</li><li>1/8 teaspoon coarse salt</li><li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano (thyme or marjoram)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> knife, bowl, baking dish</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Preheat oven to 400ºF/200ºC.</li><li>Set the squash stem-side up and cut it open by making a circular hole in the top around the stem. You want to make the opening big enough to get a spoon into the squash because you’ll be eating out of it like a bowl. Save the lid with the stem attached. (See photo below)</li><li>Spoon out all of the seeds and discard (or save for roasting later).</li><li>Mix the vegetable stock, black olives, pecans, lentils, carrots, celery, dried sage, dried oregano and salt in a bowl.</li><li>Then pour mixture into the squash, it should be enough to fill it right up to the top. Make sure to leave enough space for the lid to go back on without splashing any of the soup mixture out.</li><li>Put the lid back on the squash and place it into a baking dish. The squash will probably leak a little while cooking and this will catch the drippings.</li><li>Bake at 400ºF/200ºC for 40-60m. It is done when the interior flesh is soft enough to cut with a spoon. The larger the squash, the longer it will take to cook. Just keep checking on it. If you got a 2 pound squash the soonest you can expect it to be done is around 40minutes. For a 2.5 pounder you will probably have to wait all 60 min. Be careful not to over cook the squash as this will compromise the integrity of the shell and all of the soup will leak out.</li><li>Remove from the oven and let it cool for 15 min before moving it to a serving dish.</li><li>This is a fun dish to eat strait from the squash. While eating, scoop a little of the squash flesh into the soup so you get some with each bite.</li><li>You can also serve this in bowls. Particularly if the squash bursts! Just rescue the soup contents from the baking dish and place them in a bowl. Then scrape the soft squash flesh from the hard outer shell and mix it into the bowl with the soup.</li><li>While the squash is cooking you can toast the seeds and use them for garnish or eat as an appetizer.

We ate pesto in some form or another nearly every day for 2 weeks! Needless to say, I became a bit obsessed. In that region of Italy people eat pesto on different kinds of pasta, on top of toast and even in lasagna. The Ligurians love pesto so much that they even invented an elongated potato-flour pasta (trofie) that is designed to soak up the maximum amount of sauce per bite. Unfortunately fresh trofie is very hard to find outside of Italy, but luckily we do have access to trofie’s chubby cousin: gnocchi. Gnocchi is made from the same dough as trofie so it is often used as a replacement. The potato flour is great at soaking up the basil-ly goodness. In this recipe I have added a ton of vegetables to make it a meal you can feel good about. I don’t know how the Italians would react to adding so many vegetables to a traditionally simple pasta dish, but I love it and I hope you will too!</p><p>Notes: You should chop all the veggies into bite-sized pieces before you start cooking. If making this dish vegan, make sure to buy vegan gnocchi and use vegan pesto, or see my recipe for vegan pesto (link at the bottom).</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 2 servings</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 10m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 10m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 25m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1 cup gnocchi (if making this vegan, buy vegan gnocchi)</li><li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li><li>1 zucchini (chopped)</li><li>1 large carrot (peeled and chopped)</li><li>1 cup broccoli (chopped)</li><li>10 green beans (chopped into 2" long pieces)</li><li>1 large yellow bell pepper (remove the stem and seeds, and chop into bite-sized pieces)</li><li>2 cups fresh spinach</li><li>1 cup pesto (see my recipe for vegan pesto - link at the bottom)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> small saucepan, large skillet with lid, large bowl</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil. Then simmer the <strong>gnocchi</strong> according to the directions on the package. Try to time it so that the gnocchi is finished cooking at about the same time as the vegetables. Fresh gnocchi usually cooks in about a minute which would mean you shouldn't put the gnocchi in the water until you uncover the veggies in step 5.</li><li>Meanwhile pour the <strong>olive oil</strong> into a large skillet and heat over medium-high.</li><li>Add the chopped <strong>zucchini</strong>, <strong>carrot</strong>, <strong>broccoli</strong>, <strong>green beans</strong>, and <strong>bell pepper</strong>. Cover the veggies and sweat them for about 10 minutes.</li><li>Uncover the veggies and check the tenderness. They should be “al dente”, or cooked all the way through but still have some resistance when you bite into them. If they are still a bit too firm then cook for a few minutes uncovered. Make sure not to over cook the veggies. You don’t want them soft.</li><li>Place 2 cups of <strong>spinach</strong> in a large bowl, then add the cooked gnocchi, the cooked veggies and top with pesto.

Don’t get me wrong, I love salsa...but I didn’t really want to eat it like soup. Even though it was listed on the menu as WATERMELON gazpacho I had a really hard time identifying any watermelon flavor! I was inspired by the concept of watermelon gazpacho but underwhelmed by the result. So I did what I always do...I came home and tried to make a better version. After scouring the internet for recipes I was disappointed that all the ones I found had honey or sugar added (isn’t watermelon sweet enough on its own?). Many of them looked unappetizing (watermelon gazpacho should not be brown). So I took the best parts from many of those other recipes and came up with this: a simple, low-calorie soup that is full of fresh, seasonal produce and even looks appetizing! Plus you won’t want to dip your tortilla chips in it!</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 12 cups</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 2h30m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 2h30m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 2h30m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1/2 cup sliced red onion</li><li>1/2 cup apple cider vinegar</li><li>4 cups chopped seedless watermelon</li><li>1 large red bell pepper (roughly chopped and de-seeded)</li><li>1 cup chopped cucumber (peeled - if it has a tough skin that you wouldn’t normally eat, english cucumbers don’t need to be peeled)</li><li>1 (14.5oz) can diced tomatoes (no salt added)</li><li>1 jalapeño (roughly chopped and de-seeded)</li><li>1/4 cup fresh lime juice (1-2 limes)</li><li>1/2 teaspoon course salt</li><li>4 cups cubed seedless watermelon (1/4 - 1/2 inch cubes)</li><li>2 tablespoons chopped basil</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> blender, large fridge-safe container</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Place the sliced <strong>red onion</strong> and the <strong>vinegar</strong> into a bowl large enough to hold both and let them sit for about 15 minutes. The vinegar helps to take the bite off the onions, likewise, the onions mellow out the vinegar.</li><li>Meanwhile prepare the other ingredients. Place the first 4 cups of <strong>watermelon</strong>, <strong>bell pepper</strong>, <strong>cucumber</strong>, <strong>tomatoes</strong>, <strong>jalapeño</strong>, <strong>lime juice</strong> and <strong>salt</strong> into a blender.</li><li>Drain the <strong>onions</strong>, you can keep the vinegar to make salad dressing out of later but you won’t need it for anything else in this recipe. Then add the onions to the blender. Blend these ingredients on high until smooth.</li><li>Pour the soup base out into a fridge-safe container with a tight fitting lid. Then add the <strong>cubed watermelon</strong> and <strong>basil</strong>.

It takes patience and persistence. If you don’t get it right the first time you probably did it wrong, but that’s ok because it is really hard to do the first time. It’s like poaching eggs. The first time you get egg drop soup, but eventually you figure it out and once you get it, you get it! Who knows, maybe you will even get it right the first time! Don’t be discouraged, it took me three tries, and a chef friend of mine still has not managed (though I think that is because she gave up). Whipped coconut cream is totally worth it and hopefully with my instructions you will get it right the first time!</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 4-6 servings</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 8h10m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 8h10m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 8h10m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1 can full-fat BPA-free coconut milk</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> refrigerator, hand mixer</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Place the can of coconut milk on the bottom shelf of your refrigerator and leave it for 8 hours. What this does is it allows the milk to separate into two layers. The cream rises to the top and solidifies, while the less fatty translucent milk is pushed to the bottom of the can. The cream is what we are going to whip. If you have a fat separator (the type used for making gravy) you could try to use that to separate the milk from the cream. You can also open the can and pour the contents into a glass jar with a lid - this way you will be able to see where the separation line is.</li><li>Remove the can/glass from the refrigerator and open it. Be careful not to shake the container in any way. You need the liquids to stay separated.</li><li>Carefully scoop the cream from the top and put it into a bowl. It will make up about 1/3-1/2 of the canned milk. Make sure you do not get any of the translucent milk in the bowl or it will not whip propperly. When spooning the cream out of the can make sure not to dig down instead use a horizontal motion. Once you see the translucent milk, stop scooping. You don’t want to risk getting any of it into the bowl. (It's like whipping egg whites; if you get any egg yolk in the bowl then they won't whip propperly).</li><li>Now whip like there’s no tomorrow! Using a hand mixer on full power, whip the cream until it is fluffy. This might happen right away if the cream is super cold, or it can take up to 10 minutes. Remember whipping cow cream takes a little while too. So have patience. Just don't over whip it. You want it smooth and glossy, not lumpy.</li><li>That’s it! You should hopefully have a bowl of whipped coconut milk! No need to add sugar or any thickeners. If it is not sweet enough for you try adding some ground cinnamon or some almond extract. You can put in some sugar if you want, but usually you would use this on top of an already sweet dessert.</li></ol>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.wafflehearts.com/recipes/chocolate_apple_pie</guid><title>Chocolate Apple Pie</title><description>This chocolate mousse-y pie has a surprise in it...and it’s not apples.</description><link>https://www.wafflehearts.com/recipes/chocolate_apple_pie</link><pubDate>Thu, 6 Jun 2013 00:46:00 -0700</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chocolate Apple Pie...sounds weird right?

I decided to try making it without sugar and guess what? It turned out great! It didn’t need the refined sugar at all, just more bananas! I also was trying to find a way to add oatmeal to this bread when I came across a new discovery...oat flour!<br><br>Whether you choose to make a banana bread loaf, muffins, mini-muffins or some other crazy shape it doesn’t matter, this recipe works for all of the above.</p><p><em>Note about oat flour</em> In the instructions I tell you how to make the oat flour using a blender and rolled oats. It is very easy to do and the best option if you are making this recipe gluten-free. Alternatively you can buy oat flour as is, but it is difficult to find gluten-free oat flour. Oats and oat flour is naturally gluten-free but it is usually processed on the same machines as grains that contain gluten so there can be cross contamination unless you buy oats that are sold as “gluten-free”. Bob’s Red Mill is one company that offers gluten-free oats. Also, this recipe measures the oats by weight, but if you don't have a kitchen scale you can use volume, but it won't be as accurate. 12 ounces of oat flour is about 3 cups.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 1 loaf, 20 muffins, 48 mini-muffins</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 20m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 20m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 1h10m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>6 ripe bananas (medium - large)</li><li>2 organic eggs</li><li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li><li>1 teaspoon almond extract</li><li>12 ounces rolled oats (or oat flour - if making this recipe gluten-free make sure to get gluten-free rolled oats)</li><li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li><li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li><li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li><li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg</li><li>1/4 teaspoon fine salt</li><li>1/2 cup plain applesauce (or softened butter if you’re feeling naughty - just know that this swap adds 800 calories and 90 grams of fat)</li><li>1 cup chopped walnuts/almonds/raisins (optional)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> large bowl, medium bowl, blender, scale, baking vessel of your choice</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Preheat the oven to 350ºF/177ºC and prepare your baking vessel (e.g. loaf pan, muffin cups)</li><li>In a large bowl mash the bananas with a fork until all the chunks are gone. You can either use a fork or a potato masher. Then mix in the applesauce, eggs, vanilla and almond extracts. Set aside.</li><li>If using rolled oats, place them into a blender and puree until all of the oats are completely chopped up and resemble flour. Now you have oat flour. Depending on your blender you may want to only blend 4 ounces at a time.</li><li>Place the oat flour into a medium-sized bowl. Then add the baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt and sift these dry ingredients together.</li><li>Stir the dry mixture into the wet mixture about 1/2 cup at a time until it is all incorporated.</li><li>Fold in the chopped nuts and/or raisins if using.</li><li>Pour the batter into prepared loaf pan, muffin cups or mini-muffin cups.</li><li>Bake at 350 until a toothpick inserted in comes out clean.

You put it in the slow-cooker the night before so it is ready by the time you wake up. This also works well if you have kids or house guests and need a quick breakfast in the morning.</p><p>I tested this recipe with both rolled oats and steel cut oats. The rolled oats pretty much disintegrated after 6 hours in the slow cooker so it made a big bowl of mush. It was still tasty but didn’t quite have the desired texture. Therefore, I recommend using steel cut oats. They hold together better and give it a nice chewy texture.</p><p>You can grease the sides of the slow-cooker before you add the ingredients if you wish, but it is not necessary. The oatmeal will probably stick to the sides a little, depending on your slow-cooker. I’d recommend using a little non-stick spray or coconut oil if you use anything, but don’t feel like you have to, I never do.</p><p>*Gluten-Free: oats are naturally gluten-free, however they are usually processed on the same equipment as wheat and other gluten containing grains. If you are following a strict gluten-free diet then make sure to buy gluten-free oats. Bob’s Red Mill is one company that offers them. If you only have a minor gluten allergy then you may be fine with regular oats.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 10 cups (about 8 servings)</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 20m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 20m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 8h20m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1 cup shredded carrot (1-3 large carrots)</li><li>1 cup shredded zucchini (1-2 large zucchini)</li><li>2 cups steel cut oats (gluten-free if desired)</li><li>1 cup frozen kale</li><li>2 cups unsweetened coconut milk</li><li>7 cups water</li><li>8 pitted dates (chopped)</li><li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract (or 1 teaspoon almond extract and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract)</li><li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li><li>1 teaspoon ground cardamom</li><li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li><li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li><li>1/2 cup toasted coconut (optional)</li><li>1/2 cup toasted nuts (optional)</li><li>1/2 cup raisins (optional)</li><li>1/2 cup ground flax seeds (If you add more than 1/4 cup add a little extra water)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> slow cooker</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>First, you need to chop/shred the carrot and zucchini. You can do this several ways, either: 1. use a knife and cut into small pieces, 2. use a cheese grater to shred it, 3. place them into a blender/food processor and use the chop setting.</li><li>Place the shredded carrot and zucchini into a slow cooker, along with the oats, kale, coconut milk, water, chopped dates, ground flax seeds, vanilla extract, cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, and nutmeg.</li><li>Cook on low for 6-8 hours (depending on your slow-cooker). Some slow-cookers are hotter than others, and some have a "keep warm" setting.

That way it'll still be warm when you get up after a full night's sleep.</li><li>Serve with toasted coconut, toasted nuts and raisins and let people add as much as they want.

There is a step in this recipe called degorging. It is very important when working with eggplant because it improves their taste and texture. Salting helps to get the juices in the eggplant flowing (similar to salting meat before cooking) and it draws out the bitterness while preparing the eggplant to absorb all of the good flavors in your recipe.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 1 roasted eggplant</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 25m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 25m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 45m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1 eggplant</li><li>1/4 cup coarse salt</li><li>1 tablespoon dried minced onion</li><li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li><li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li><li>1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li><li>1/4 teaspoon garlic granules</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> baking sheet, parchment paper, colander</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Preheat oven to 425ºF/220ºC and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li><li>Chop the eggplant into either 1” cubes or 1/4” slices and degorge it. This is done by generously sprinkling salt onto the chopped pieces to draw out any bitter liquid in the eggplant. Place the salted eggplant in a colander or on a grate above a bowl or sink for about 20 minutes to let the liquid drain away. Then rinse off the salt in cold water and gently squeeze out any excess liquid. I usually place the squeezed pieces onto paper towels while I work my way through them just to make sure all excess liquid is gone.</li><li>Place the eggplant in a large bowl and toss with the onion, oregano, cumin cayenne and garlic. There’s no need to salt it, it will have absorbed some of the salt from the degorging.</li><li>Place the eggplant on the parchment paper lined baking sheet and bake for 20-30 minutes. They will take a bit longer if they are cubed instead of sliced.</li><li>Toss into a salad, on top of a sandwich or into your favorite pasta dish.</li></ol>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.wafflehearts.com/recipes/kajas_carrot-cake_muffins</guid><title>Kaja’s Carrot-Cake Muffins</title><description>These sweet little treats have no added sugar, no oil or butter and are made with whole-wheat pastry flour.

You can make these as regular full-sized muffins but our favorite way to have them is as mini muffins! I’m not much of a baker which is why this recipe comes strait from the kitchen of my confection aficionado friend Kaja. She’s a wiz with the KitchenAid and mixed up this recipe as a sweet, healthy treat for her 1 year old.</p><p>For the add-ins you can add up to 2 cups of your choice of raisins, coconut, nuts or chocolate chips. You can do any combination you like, that’s part of what makes this recipe great. Try 1 cup raisins, 1/2 cup walnuts and 1/2 cup chocolate chips for my favorite, or create your own combination.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 34 mini muffins/15 muffins</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 15m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 15m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 30m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1 2/3 cups whole-wheat pastry flour</li><li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li><li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li><li>1/4 teaspoon fine salt</li><li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li><li>1/2 teaspoon ground clove</li><li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg</li><li>1 1/2 cups grated carrots (3-5 large carrots)</li><li>1 1/2 cups unsweetened apple sauce</li><li>5 dried plums (lovingly known as prunes)</li><li>3 pitted dates</li><li>2 organic eggs</li><li>1/4 cup mashed ripe banana (1 medium banana)</li><li>2 cups add-ins (optional: raisins, coconut, chopped nuts, dark chocolate chips)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> muffin tin/mini muffin tin, large bowl, blender/food processor</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Preheat the oven to 350ºF/175ºC. Grease cupcake tins with coconut oil or use paper liners. Try to use liners with wax or foil inside. Since this recipe has almost no fat in it the muffins tend to stick to plain paper liners.</li><li>In a large bowl sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, clove and nutmeg.</li><li>Place the carrots into a food processor and pulse until you get a medium to fine shredded mixture. Measure the amount of shredded carrots, you will need about 1 1/2 cups. Remove 1/2 of the carrots and stir them into the dry mixture in the large bowl, leave the other 1/2 in the blender.</li><li>Add the applesauce, prunes, dates, eggs and mashed banana to the remaining carrots in the blender. Puree on high until smooth.</li><li>Pour the wet mixture from the blender onto the dry mixture in the bowl and fold together gently with a spatula. Be careful not to over mix. You want the dry ingredients to be well incorporated but over mixing will knock all of the air out and cause the cakes to be dense and heavy.</li><li>Gently mix in the raisins, coconut, chopped nuts, and/or chocolate chips. You can reserve some of the coconut/nuts/chocolate chips to sprinkle on top if you wish.</li><li>Fill the cupcake tins/liners almost to the top with batter. These will not rise very much so it’s important to fill the cups pretty full. Sprinkle with the remaining coconut/nuts/chocolate chips if you decided to reserve some.</li><li>Bake in the middle of the oven. If making mini muffins bake for 15-18 minutes. If making regular-sized muffins bake for 22-25 minutes. They are done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li><li>Cool on a wire rack then store in an airtight container for up to 4 days or freeze for up to 3 months.

You can put it in soups to add creaminess. Replace most or all of the cheese in enchiladas and tacos. When making lasagna it can be used as the white sauce/ricotta layer. Use it as a base for salad dressings. Top off your desserts with a dollop of thick cashew cream instead of cholesterol-filled whipped cream. There are many many more possibilities. The choice is yours!</p><p>There are two tricks to making this decadent cream: 1. use raw cashews (not roasted), 2. plan ahead because they need to be soaked overnight. If you have a powerful blender, like a Vitamix, you can skip the soaking step and save yourself about 8 hours of soaking time, otherwise, soaking is required to soften the nuts.</p><p>This recipe is for a very basic cashew cream. You can always add other things to spruce it up like garlic powder, cayenne pepper, nutritional yeast, avocado, salt, etc.</p><p>I recommend making cashew cream in small batches because it only lasts a 3-4 days before it goes bad. Just make as much as you can use in a day or two. I have written this recipe to use 1 cup of cashews because it is an easy amount to work with. Since you use equal parts cashews and water, you can use any amount of cashews. This ratio of 1:1 makes a cashew cream that is the consistency of cream. To make a thicker cream use a few more cashews or a little less water. Likewise to make it thinner just use more water.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 1 1/2 cups</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 5m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 5m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 5m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1 cup raw cashews</li><li>water (fresh and cold)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> blender</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Measure out the <strong>cashews</strong> into a strainer and rinse in cold water. The reason you need to measure is because you use about equal parts water to cashews. I recommend starting with 1 cup cashews until you figure out how much is a good amount for you. This will yield about 1 1/2 cups cashew cream.</li><li>Place rinsed cashews into a container with a lid. Pour in enough cold water to cover the cashews, then put on the lid and place in the refrigerator over night (or before you go to work). They should soak for 6-10 hours. (If you have a powerful blender skip the soaking step and proceed to step 3).</li><li>Drain the cashews, rinse again in cold water and place them into a blender.</li><li>Add 3/4 - 1 cup water. I recommend starting with less water then adding more if you need it. The amount you use will make the cream more or less thick.</li><li>Blend on high until smooth.</li><li>Refrigerate and use within 3-4 days.</li></ol>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.wafflehearts.com/recipes/almond_chicken_with_veggies_au_jus</guid><title>Almond Chicken with Veggies au Jus</title><description>Chicken and veggies sautéed with almond oil and served in their own juices.

(If you have not heard of the True Food Kitchen or Dr. Weil google them now! The restaurants focus on using healthy, often organic, seasonal ingredients, environmental awareness, and support following an anti-inflammatory diet.) They served the vinaigrette over roasted winter veggies and it was amazing. So I came home and tried to create something similar. Try it over roasted veggies, as a salad dressing or even as a sauce for meat!</p><p>About the ingredients: - Prepared horseradish comes in a jar that can be found in the refrigerated section of your local grocery store. - Mustard powder can be found in the baking aisle with the spices. Not only does it add flavor to the vinaigrette but it helps the olive oil and vinegar keep from separating. If you do not want to use the powder you can use prepared mustard.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 1 cup<br><br><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 5m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 5m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 5m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1/4 cup apple cider vinegar</li><li>4 tablespoons prepared horseradish</li><li>1/2 teaspoon dry mustard powder (or 1 tsp prepared mustard)</li><li>1/2 teaspoon garlic granules</li><li>1 teaspoon dried dill</li><li>3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li><li>salt and pepper ( to taste)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> blender or whisk</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Combine the vinegar, horseradish, dry mustard powder, garlic powder and dill and whisk/blend until well combined.</li><li>Continue whisking while adding the olive oil. Slowly drizzle in 1/4 cup at a time. This will help the olive oil to suspend and stay combined longer. If you let it sit for a long time it will separate. Taste it then season with salt and pepper.</li><li>Use right away or refrigerate and use within a week. If you refrigerate it you will need to take it out and let it come to room temp (about 30 min) because the olive oil solidifies and may separate. Just give it a quick whisk before using.</li></ol>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.wafflehearts.com/recipes/lemon_veggie_tagine</guid><title>Lemon Veggie Tagine</title><description>Lemon’s normally sour flavor gets a savory overhaul in this vegetarian Moroccan tagine. And don't worry, you don't have to have a tagine to make this.</description><link>https://www.wafflehearts.com/recipes/lemon_veggie_tagine</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Mar 2013 21:04:00 -0700</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first time I ate preserved lemons was in the Lemon Chicken Tagine recipe that came with my Le Creuset tagine and WOW was it a revelation! Lemony but also a mouthwateringly salty flavor, not at all the sour tang that usually accompanies lemon. Since I am currently on a vegan kick I took out the chicken and added a bunch of healthy veggies! This makes a great main course whether you are vegetarian or not. It can be served alongside whole grains if desired, try brown rice or brown rice noodles. Also, I had one taste tester request for this dish to be spicy. Feel free to toss in some roasted red pepper flakes if you want it with a kick. This can be done after it is dished up so not everyone has to have it spicy.</p><p>Notes: - Degorging the eggplant is a very important step and shouldn’t be skipped. I made this once without doing it and the whole tagine tasted awfully bitter. If you do not want to use eggplant you can replace it with extra zucchini and carrots. - If following an Engine 2 diet, omit the olive oil and and use steam sauté technique with vegetable stock. - If you are using home-cooked beans instead of canned, great! Just measure out 1.5 cups, that's about how much is in a can. - This recipe makes 2 large servings or 4 small servings, depends on how hungry you are! If you serve it with brown rice or brown rice noodles then it is definitely 4 servings. - If you don't have a tagine you can use a saucepan or dutch oven with a tight fitting lid. If the lid has one of those vent holes in it to vent out steam, or doesn't fit properly just make sure to keep an eye on the liquid level so this doesn't burn. It is a stew so it should cook in a good amount of liquid.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 2-4 servings</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 20m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 20m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 1h20m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1 tablespoon olive oil (Engine 2: omit this and use steam sauté technique with vegetable stock)</li><li>1 small yellow onion (diced)</li><li>5 garlic cloves (crushed)</li><li>1 large carrot (chopped into 1/4" thick rounds)</li><li>1 celery stalk (diced)</li><li>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</li><li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro (divided)</li><li>1 cup low-sodium vegetable stock</li><li>1 preserved lemon (this should be 4 pieces/quarters if you followed my recipe for preserving lemons)</li><li>2 cups chopped eggplant (about 1 medium globe or Italian eggplant)</li><li>1/4 cup coarse salt (e.g. coarse kosher salt)</li><li>1 zucchini (chopped into 1/2”thick half moons)</li><li>1 can garbanzo beans (drained )</li><li>2 cups hearty greens (arugula/chard/collard greens/kale/spinach/etc)</li><li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li><li>red pepper flakes (optional)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> tagine (or saucepan with lid), colander or grate to drain eggplant on</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Heat the olive oil in the tagine over medium high heat then add the onion, garlic, carrot and celery then sauté until they are just beginning to brown (3-5 minutes).</li><li>Add the turmeric, 2 tablespoons of cilantro and vegetable stock then reduce the heat to low.</li><li>Rinse the lemon pieces in cold water then cut away and discard the flesh. You will be cooking with the lemon rind. Slice the rind into thin strips and stir these into the dish.</li><li>Cover and simmer for 30 minutes, until the vegetables soften. Keep the heat as low as possible to maintain the simmer.</li><li>Meanwhile, chop the eggplant into 1” cubes and degorge it. This is done by generously sprinkling salt onto the chopped pieces and letting the water drain from them. Place the salted eggplant in a colander or on a grate above a bowl or sink to let the liquid drain away. Let the eggplant sit in the salt and drain for about 20 minutes then rinse off the salt in cold water and gently squeeze out any excess liquid.</li><li>While the eggplant is degorging, chop the zucchini into 1/2” pieces, and drain the garbanzo beans.</li><li>After the 30 minutes cooking time is up, stir in the eggplant, zucchini and garbanzo beans, making sure they are well mixed in. Then cover, turn up the heat to return to a simmer. Continue to simmer for another 30 minutes. Once the simmer is reached you can turn the heat back down to the lowest temperature needed to keep it simmering. You will end up with a lot of eggplant sitting above the sauce so every 10 minutes give it a stir just to make sure all of the eggplant has a turn in the sauce.</li><li>The sauce consistency should be thick, if you have a lot of liquid left then remove the lid, and cook uncovered for a few minutes to thicken.

That’s when I knew this one was a keeper. I have made several vegan lasagnas before and they have all been okay but not great. Mostly other peoples recipes, some using super-processed vegan “cheese” that is tasty but not all that healthy, and doesn’t really melt properly. Others used tofu to replace the ricotta layer, I have never been a fan of tofu. After quite a bit of experimentation I decided to make a white bean puree to replace the ricotta layer and it worked out marvelously.</p><p>For the chopped veggies I like to use a combination of broccoli, Brussels sprouts, carrots, cauliflower, parsnips and zucchini. Feel free to leave any of these out if you don’t want to use them, or substitute with other vegetables.</p><p>If you are using home-cooked beans instead of canned, great! Just measure out 1.5 cups, that's about how much is in a can.</p><p>If you plan to have garlic bread with this you will want to have a head of garlic and some bread on hand (no butter necessary). There's a link for my Roasted Garlic Bread recipe below.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 4 servings</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 30m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 30m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 2h</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>4 cups chopped veggies</li><li>1 small yellow onion</li><li>1 can white beans (e.g. navy beans/ drained and rinsed)</li><li>5 garlic cloves (peeled)</li><li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li><li>1/4 cup nutritional yeast</li><li>3/4 cup ground cashews (divided)</li><li>24 ounces pasta sauce (Engine 2: make sure to get a fat-free approved sauce)</li><li>4-5 whole grain lasagna noodles</li><li>1 cup kale (chopped into 1" pieces)</li><li>2 tablespoons fresh basil (cut into ribbons)</li><li>1/2 cup green lentils (uncooked)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> roasting dish/baking sheet, saucepan, blender, 9x9 lasagna dish</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Preheat oven to 450ºF/230ºC.</li><li>Chop the veggies into bite sized or smaller pieces then place on a parchment paper lined roasting dish/baking sheet.</li><li>Dice the onion into 1/2” pieces and add to the roasting dish. Spread the veggies and onion out so they are in a single layer. If necessary use two roasting dishes. If the veggies overlap they will steam in stead of roasting. Roast at 450ºF/230ºC for 30 min.</li><li>Meanwhile put the lentils in a small saucepan with 1 1/2 cups water and boil for 25 - 30 minutes until they are soft but not falling apart. They should absorb all of the water, if not just drain off the excess.</li><li>While the lentils and vegetables are cooking you can grind the cashews and make the white bean puree. First put 1/2 cup cashews into a blender and process until they are ground. Do not process too long or they could get gummy. You want them crumbly. Pour them out into a small bowl and set aside.</li><li>Next combine the white beans, garlic, oregano, nutritional yeast and remaining 1/4 cup cashews in the blender with 1/2 cup water and process until smooth. If you have a very good blender this will be a medium speed, if you have a blender that is a bit older or doesn’t have as much horsepower then process on high in 60-second intervals until you are happy with the consistency, it will likely end up a bit chunkier but that’s ok. Season to taste with a pinch of salt.</li><li>When you remove the veggies from the oven turn the heat down to 400ºF/200ºC.</li><li>If you are planning to have this with <a href="https://wafflehearts.com/recipes/roasted-garlic-bread">Roasted Garlic Bread</a> you'll want to put the garlic in at the same time as the lasagna since it needs about an hour to cook.</li><li>Assemble the layers of the lasagna in a 9x9 lasagna dish. Spread the ingredients of each layer out evenly. Starting from the bottom the layers are:</li><li>1 cup pasta sauce</li><li>single layer of lasagna noodles</li><li>roasted vegetables</li><li>white bean puree</li><li>single layer of lasagna noodles</li><li>1 cup pasta sauce</li><li>kale</li><li>lentils</li><li>1 cup pasta sauce</li><li>Cover and bake at 400ºF/200ºC for 45 min. Then remove from the oven, uncover and sprinkle the cashews evenly across the top. Return the oven and bake uncovered for another 15 min to brown the cashews.</li><li>Remove from oven and let rest 10 minutes before serving.

Add 1 tablespoon olive oil then 1 tablespoon butter. Wait for the butter to stop foaming then add the mushrooms and sauté until they release their juices (3-5 minutes). Using a slotted spoon remove the mushrooms and set aside.</li><li>Add the diced shallots and garlic to the pan and sauté for a minute, then add chicken and brown it on both sides (1 - 2 min per side).</li><li>Pour 1 cup of chicken stock into pan. Then pour the wine into the pan, you may not need all of it, you want to pour until you can just barely see the top of the chicken pieces. Stir in the tomato paste, oregano and bay leaf.</li><li>Turn the heat down to the lowest temperature possible to keep it at a simmer. Simmer gently for 30 minutes.</li><li>Meanwhile rinse the quinoa in a fine-mesh strainer, then put it into a small saucepan with 1 cup of water.

Drain off any excess water and keep warm in a small bowl.</li><li>Using the small saucepan again, add the chopped carrot, zucchini, Brussels sprouts, and green beans. Cover them with cold water and turn the burner on to high. Set a timer for 10 minutes, as soon as it goes off remove the veggies from the heat and test for tenderness. They should be firm yet easily pierced with a fork. Drain, then set aside and keep warm.</li><li>The chicken should be finished cooking by now. Use a slotted spoon to remove the chicken from the pan and set aside. You can put it in with the veg if you want (as long as the veg is finished cooking and has been drained - otherwise put it with the quinoa).</li><li>Measure the remaining liquid in the pan, then return it to the pan. For every cup of liquid you will need 1 tablespoon each of flour and butter. Measure the flour and butter into a small bowl and mash them together; this is a called a beurre manié (French for kneaded butter). Bring the liquid up to a simmer and whisk/stir in the beurre manié. Continue whisking constantly. The sauce will start to thicken as it simmers; it will only take a few minutes. You want it thick enough the “enrobe” the chicken (as Julia Child says). Taste the sauce and add salt to taste.</li><li>Once the sauce is thick enough add back in all of the prepared ingredients: chicken, par-boiled veggies, quinoa, mushrooms.</li><li>Enjoy this dish hot with a loved and savor every bite! It goes great with a glass of wine and a crusty baguette.</li></ol>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.wafflehearts.com/recipes/to_the_rescue_tea</guid><title>To The Rescue Tea</title><description>Lemon’s antibacterial, antiviral and immune-boosting properties combined with green tea’s antioxidants, ginger’s nausea eliminating ability and cinnamon’s fever reducing powers make a tea that is designed to fight sickness and make you feel better, even if you aren’t sick.</description><link>https://www.wafflehearts.com/recipes/to_the_rescue_tea</link><pubDate>Wed, 6 Mar 2013 17:55:00 -0800</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I like to make this tea and set the teapot on my desk while I work. I drink a little at a time throughout my work day. It’s great because it gets more lemony and cinnamon-y the longer it sits which means the flavor evolves over time so I’m not drinking the same exact tea all tea. This works best if you have a teapot that has a warmer underneath. Mine goes into a holder that suspends it above a tea light. Here’s a quick rundown of what the ingredients do: - Green tea - antibacterial and full of antioxidants and polyphenols to protect your health - Manuka honey - antibiotic, antibacterial and full of antioxidants to help you stay well and get better - Ginger extract - anti-inflammatory, fever reducer, cough suppressant, nausea reducer and pain reliever - Vanilla extract - provides trace minerals: calcium, magnesium, potassium, manganese, iron and zinc, plus it reduces anxiety through nervous system support - Cinnamon - anti-fungal, antibacterial, anti-parasitic, anti-inflammatory and fever reducer - Lemon - antibacterial, antiviral, good source of vitamin C - Clove - anesthetic, anti-bacterial, antiseptic, anti-fungal, germicide, helps reduce gas, indigestion, nausea and hiccups</p><p>About the ingredients: - Green tea - you can use any green tea, even flavored ones. If you use a flavored one, try to pick one that would compliment the other ingredients in this recipe. I recommend using high quality, loose leaf, organic green tea. - Manuka Honey comes from the manuka tree in New Zealand. It can be found in the honey aisle at health food groceries like Whole Foods Market and Sprouts as well as on Amazon. However it is pricy, so if you don't want to spend the money then you can use regular honey but I'd recommend a raw honey as it has a higher quantity of antioxidants than regular honey. - Ginger extract is very spicy. The amount used in this recipe does not make a very spicy tea but if you would like it with a little more kick feel free to add more. You can find ginger extract in the vitamin section of health food groceries.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 5 cup of tea</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 5m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 5m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 15m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>5 cups green tea</li><li>2 teaspoons Manuka honey (make sure to get 100% raw, organic honey)</li><li>1/2 teaspoon ginger extract</li><li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li><li>1 cinnamon stick</li><li>1 lemon</li><li>16 whole cloves</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> Teapot with a warmer or saucepan</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Brew the tea.

If the tea tastes bitter you have over-steeped it or the water was too hot. You cannot salvage over-steeped tea, just throw it out and start over.</li><li>Stir in the honey, ginger and vanilla until the honey dissolves.</li><li>Drop in the cinnamon stick.</li><li>Chop the top and bottom ends off the lemon and squeeze the juice from them into the tea. Then cut the remaining body into 4 thick slices.</li><li>Put 4 whole cloves into each of the lemon pieces. Then place the lemons into the teapot with the clove heads facing up so they don’t fall out of the lemons into your tea. Putting the cloves into the lemons keeps them from coming out of the spout when you pour it into your cup.</li><li>Keep the tea warm and let it sit for 10 minutes to let all of the flavors infuse. This works best if you have a teapot warmer. If you don’t you could use a teapot cosy, or pour the concoction into a saucepan and heat until it is ready to drink. Enjoy it hot!</li></ol><p>References: <a href="http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/benefits-of/clove">Global Healing Center: Benefits of Clove</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
